SESSION ERRORS & FIXES SUMMARY (Version 3.7.9)
===========================================

1. FIXED: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'
   - Cause: Newer Python versions (3.12+) removed distutils.
   - Fix: Added 'setuptools' to backend/requirements.txt and scraper.py auto-install.

2. FIXED: Folder Setting Errors (Encoding/Corrupt Config)
   - Cause: File.check_existence used system default encoding instead of UTF-8. Paths with special characters (e.g., 'Michał') caused JSON corruption.
   - Fix: Enforced UTF-8 encoding in File.check_existence and refactored for robustness.

3. FIXED: .bat files disappearing after launch
   - Cause: start_silent.bat used 'git reset --hard', which deleted local untracked or modified scripts.
   - Fix: Removed 'git reset --hard' from startup logic.

4. FIXED: Paths not updating immediately in UI
   - Cause: renderer.js saveSettings() read from DOM before the DOM was updated with the new selected path.
   - Fix: Explicitly update DOM element value before calling saveSettings().

5. FIXED: SteamRIP / Cyberpunk Download Logic
   - Cause: Downloader failed if more than one download link was found on the page (e.g., multiple Buzzheavier mirrors).
   - Fix: Updated regex logic to select the first available link instead of failing.

6. FIXED: Inaccurate Game Search (Fuzzy Matching)
   - Cause: Fuzzy search (difflib) was too lenient, showing unrelated games like 'Smile Rancher' for 'Slime Rancher'.
   - Fix: Removed fuzzy search; now uses strict substring and prefix matching.

7. FIXED: [WinError 32] File access error during Finalize
   - Cause: OS held locks on files immediately after extraction, causing move/rename to fail.
   - Fix: Added a 2-second delay and a 5-attempt retry loop for file move operations on Windows.

8. IMPROVED: Network Reliability
   - Added 30-second timeouts to all requests and session calls in DownloadManager to prevent the app from getting stuck on unresponsive servers.

OBSERVED LOG ERRORS (To be addressed):
- [charmap] codec can't decode byte 0x88 (encoding mismatch in filename handling).
- [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified (during GOG scan).
